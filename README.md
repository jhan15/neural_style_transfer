# neural_style_transfer

Transfer a content image into the style of a style image.

- A pre-trained VGG19 model is employed as feature extactor of content and style of an image.

- A weighted loss function of content loss, style loss, and total variation loss is used as the optimization objective.

- Adam optimizer is used for training.

## Usage
